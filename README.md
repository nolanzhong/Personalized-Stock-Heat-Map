# Personalized-Stock-Heat-Map

## Overview
As passionate stock investors, we found existing heatmaps lacked customization to analyze our specific holdings over time. This inspired us to develop the Customizable Stock Heat Maps web app - a dynamic tool giving users control over building heatmap views of their portfolios. Through an intuitive interface selecting stocks and customizable visualizations with real-time market data, the app provides valuable insights into movement and health of user-defined equities across adjustable periods. Our goals are to deliver tailored market intelligence through engaging features to support making informed investment decisions, while gaining experience developing a full-stack personal finance tool.
